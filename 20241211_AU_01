It started giving a quick crash course on image file types. In a nutshell, an image file is a matrix where each entry contains three numbers that stand for the intensity of three foundamental colors from which combination any color is generated, RGB(red, green, blue). There a two main types, "fixed matrix" images (forgot the exact jargon) and vector images, which basically store a sort of "geometric formula" from which generate tha image, so it doesnt loss much resolution with zooming.
